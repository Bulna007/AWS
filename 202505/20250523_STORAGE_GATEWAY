Storage gateway
----------------
Storage gateway offers hybrid-model of running on-premise applications on the cloud infrastructure. if our applications are designed and coded to work on on-premise, moving them onto the cloudplatform is difficult task and we need to
  1. rewrite the application to use cloud sdk or api to persist the data onto the cloud services
  2. we need to recreate an equivalent infrastructure inorder to move the applications from datacenter to cloud
  3. move all the data on on-premise onto the cloud
    
rewriting the applications involves re-development of the existing applications and cost involved in re-development/deploying them will be very high and cannot move all of them overnight onto the cloud

By using the help of storage gateway, the existing applications which are running on datacenter servers doesnt need to be re-written, rather through the help of storage gateway they can push the application data generated on the on-premise servers to the aws cloudplatform. So that the applications which are running on on-premise and cloud uses the same storage/data to run. Over the period of time we can migrate the whole bunch of applications to the cloud demolishing the on-premise infrastructure

There are 3 types of storage gateways are there:
1. Volume / File gateway
2. Tape gateway
3. S3 gateway
